# Front-End Web Developer On-boarding Project

This is a simple demo for the front end on-boarding project written in HTML, CSS, and JS.

For time sake, no preprocessors or extra libraries were used.

The demo can be found here: https://mhynson.github.io/mittun-ovante-steps/

## Update steps or active step

To specify a number of steps or change the active step, you can use the onscreen dropdowns. 

Alternatively, you can the query parameters `steps=X` and `active=Y`, where `X` is a number that represents the number of steps and `Y` is a number that represents the active step.

ex. https://mhynson.github.io/mittun-ovante-steps/?steps=15&active=3
